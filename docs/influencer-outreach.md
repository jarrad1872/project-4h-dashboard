# Saw.City LITE — Influencer Outreach Campaign
### Project 4H: Trade Creator Partnerships
*Last updated: 2026-02-28*

## 1. Executive Summary

### Why Influencer > Paid Ads for Trade Conversion

Contractors don't buy from ads. They buy from other contractors.

The single biggest trust signal in the trades is **peer endorsement**. A roofer trusts another roofer's recommendation more than any Facebook retargeting ad. YouTube has become the watercooler for trade professionals — it's where they learn, commiserate, and make buying decisions.

**Here's the math on why influencer beats paid:**
- Average CPL for home service/contractor software via paid search: **$80–$180/lead**
- Conversion rate from cold paid traffic: **2–5%**
- Influencer referral conversion rate (warm, peer-endorsed): **8–15%** (industry benchmark)
- Influencer trust carries: a mention at 200K subs with 10% trade audience = **20,000 warm prospects**

**The Saw.City deal is uniquely influencer-friendly:**
- $10/month per referral for up to 24 months = **up to $240/contractor**
- Recurring passive income — not one-time affiliate
- Low price point ($79/mo) means easy yes from contractors with phone anxiety
- Co-branded landing page makes creators look like partners, not promoters

**This campaign targets the "1,000 true contractors" model** — each creator only needs to convert 10–50 contractors to generate $2,400–$12,000/year in recurring revenue. That's compelling for creators who are also business owners.

### 🏠 ROOFING → roofrepair.city

| Channel | Subscribers | Content Type | Audience Fit | Contact |
|---------|-------------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **Roofing Insights** (Dmitry Lipinskiy) | 75K–100K | Industry news, product reviews, controversy, business | Pure roofing contractors | roofinginsights.com |

### 🦟 PEST CONTROL → pest.city

| Channel | Subscribers | Content Type | Audience Fit | Contact |
|---------|-------------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **Pest Geek Podcast** | 10–25K YT (large podcast audience) | Technical training, products, marketing, SEO | Pure pest control operators and technicians | pestgeekpodcast.com |
| **DoMyOwnPestControl** | 60K | DIY pest control how-to | ⚠️ DIY homeowners primarily — lower fit | domyownpestcontrol.com |
| **Town & Country Pest Solutions** | 47K | NY pest company — real job videos | Mixed consumer + operator | townandcountrysolutions.com |

| **Eric The Bug Guy** / independent operators | Varies | Day-in-the-life tech vlogs | Technicians | Via YouTube |

**⚠️ Honest Assessment: Pest Control**
This is the hardest vertical for YouTube influencer reach. The pest control YouTube ecosystem is significantly smaller than HVAC/plumbing/electrical. No single creator dominates with 100K+ contractor-focused subs. Best approach:
- Pest Geek Podcast is #1 in audio — consider podcast sponsorship + YouTube combo
- DoMyOwnPestControl has reach but DIY audience (not contractor)
- May need to supplement with industry trade publications (PCT, Pest Management Professional)

**Top Pick: Pest Geek Podcast (Jamie Jeffords)**
- Self-described "world's #1 pest control training podcast" for operators
- Covers business growth, marketing, products — perfect fit
- Operator + technician audience
- URL: https://www.youtube.com/@PestGeekPodcast / pestgeekpodcast.com

**Estimated deal value:** More limited. If 15K active operator followers, 2% conversion = 300 × $240 = **$72,000 LTV for creator** (smaller but highly targeted).

| **Lawn Care Life** (Jason Creel) | 172K | Starting + building a lawn care business | New and established business operators | start-lawncarebusiness.com |

**🏆 Best Trade for This Campaign**
Lawn care is the single strongest vertical. Multiple 200K–500K channels, all contractor/operator focused, actively doing sponsorships.

**Top Pick: Mike Andes**
- Explicitly positioned as "home service business millionaire"
- Goal is to "make small business owners rich" — audience are operators
- Runs Augusta Lawn Care franchise (200+ locations)
- Has shown willingness to promote tools that help operators
- URL: https://www.youtube.com/@MikeAndes / mikeandes.com

**Second Pick: Brian's Lawn Maintenance**
- 247K subs, posts 3x/week
- Mix of business advice + day-in-the-life — high engagement
- Actively promotes products and tools he actually uses
- URL: https://www.youtube.com/@BriansLawnMaintenance

**Estimated deal value (Blades of Grass):** 511K subs, ~60% operators = 307K audience. 0.5% conversion = 1,535 × $240 = **$368,400 LTV for creator** — highest potential in this campaign.

### 🎨 PAINTING → coat.city

| Channel | Subscribers | Content Type | Audience Fit | Contact |
|---------|-------------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **Painting Business Pro** (Eric Barstow) | 45K+ | Business systems, sales, pricing, growth | Pure painting contractors and owners | paintingbusinesspro.com |

| **The Painter's Apprentice** | 20K+ | Technical painting tutorials | Mix of apprentices and professionals | Via YouTube |
| **Repaint Network** | Various | Painting business owners community | Painting contractors | Via YouTube/Facebook |

**⚠️ Honest Assessment: Painting**
Like pest control, the painting contractor YouTube ecosystem is smaller than the big trades. Most painting contractor content creators have under 50K subscribers. Painting Business Pro (Eric Barstow) is the clear #1, but 45K is modest. 

Consider supplementing with The Painting Podcast (audio-first) or Painter's Weekly communities.

**Top Pick: Painting Business Pro (Eric Barstow)**
- ONLY meaningful contractor-focused painting channel with real scale
- Runs coaching program for painters — audience is serious business operators
- Has done in-video sponsored content before
- URL: https://www.youtube.com/@PaintingBusinessPro / paintingbusinesspro.com

**Estimated deal value:** 45K subs, ~80% painting contractors = 36K. 1% conversion = 360 × $240 = **$86,400 LTV for creator**.

- Perfect peer tone: "I was you, here's what I used to build it"
- URL: https://www.youtube.com/@kingofpressurewash / kingofpressurewashing.com

**Estimated deal value:** 50K subs, ~70% operators = 35K. 1.5% conversion = 525 × $240 = **$126,000 LTV for creator**.

## 3. Outreach Email Template

**Subject:** Quick question — want to make $10/month from every contractor you send our way

---

Hey [Name],

I've been watching your channel for a while. You're one of the few creators who talks about running the business, not just doing the work — that's exactly who we built Saw.City for.

Here's the short version: **Saw.City LITE is an AI that answers your phone for you.** $79/month. When a contractor misses a call at 9pm because they're on a job, the AI picks up, qualifies the lead, takes the message, and books the callback. It does not sound like a robot.

We built it specifically for trade contractors — plumbers, HVAC guys, electricians, roofers. The guys watching your channel.

**The deal we're offering creators:**
$10/month for every contractor you refer, for up to 24 months. That's up to **$240 per contractor**, paid monthly as long as they stay subscribed. No cap on referrals. You get a unique code and a co-branded landing page we'll build specifically for you (like mow.city/[yourname]).

This isn't a one-time affiliate click. It's recurring income. If 50 contractors in your audience sign up, that's $500/month — every month — for two years.

What I'm asking: **one honest mention in a video** where you talk about business tools. You don't have to fake excitement you don't have. If you try it and it genuinely helps guys like your audience, say that. If it doesn't fit, tell me and we'll move on — no pressure.

Would you be open to trying Saw.City LITE for a month, on us, and seeing if it fits what your audience needs?

[Your name]
[Title], Saw.City
[phone / email]

P.S. The landing page offer is time-limited — we're giving the first 20 creators their own co-branded city subdomain (e.g., mow.city/brianslawn). After that we'll need to evaluate on a case-by-case basis.

4. **Dashboard access** — Creator gets a live dashboard showing click count, signups, active subscribers, monthly earnings

Payout triggers at $50 minimum. Auto-paid monthly. If a subscriber cancels and resubscribes with same code, creator gets credit on the new subscription from month 1.

### What Saw.City Provides

- **Co-branded landing page** hosted on the trade-specific subdomain (mow.city, pipe.city, etc.)
- **Dedicated partner rep** — one human contact for the creator, not a ticketing system
- **Custom creative assets** — thumbnail graphics, video cutaway clips if needed

### Terms

- Payout continues for 24 months per subscriber from the date they signed up
- If creator's code generates a subscriber, that subscriber is "locked" to that creator for 24 months regardless of whether creator continues promoting
- Minimum payout: $50/month before transfer
- Creator can promote as many or as few times as they choose — no exclusivity required

## 5. Priority Hit List — Top 10 Creators Across All Trades

Ranking formula: **(Contractor Audience Purity × Estimated Contractor Reach × Conversion Probability)**

| Rank | Creator | Trade | Channel | Est. Contractor Reach | Conv. Probability | Deal Page |

| 🥇 1 | **Mike Andes** | Lawn Care | youtube.com/@MikeAndes | 80K+ operators | Very High (business ops audience) | mow.city/mikeandes |
| 🥈 2 | **Brian's Lawn Maintenance** | Lawn Care | youtube.com/@BriansLawnMaintenance | 150K+ operators | High (active sponsor, loyal audience) | mow.city/brianslawn |
| 🥉 3 | **AC Service Tech LLC** | HVAC | youtube.com/@ACServiceTech | 90K+ techs/owners | Very High (pure tech audience) | duct.city/acservicetech |
| 4 | **Blades of Grass Lawn Care** | Lawn Care | youtube.com/channel/UCPIZI7... | 300K+ operators | Medium-High | mow.city/bladesofgrass |
| 5 | **HVAC School (Bryan Orr)** | HVAC | youtube.com/@HVACSchool | 60K+ techs/owners | Very High (business-minded operators) | duct.city/hvacschool |

| 10 | **Painting Business Pro (Barstow)** | Painting | youtube.com/@PaintingBusinessPro | 36K operators | Very High (coaching audience = serious owners) | coat.city/paintingbizpro |

### Why These 10 Over Anyone Else

The ranking prioritizes **audience purity** (what % are actual contractors, not homeowners/students) over raw subscriber count. A 50K-sub channel where 80% are operators is worth more than a 500K channel where 10% are contractors.

Top 3 to hit first: **Mike Andes, Brian's Lawn Maintenance, AC Service Tech LLC** — best combination of reach, audience fit, and creator personality match.

## 6. Research Notes — What Was Found vs. What Couldn't Be Confirmed

### ✅ Verified (Real channels, confirmed subscriber ranges)
- Roger Wakefield: 600K+, 100M+ views ✅
- Brian's Lawn Maintenance: 247K ✅
- Blades of Grass Lawn Care: 511K ✅
- Top Notch Lawn Care: 387K ✅

- DoMyOwnPestControl: 60.1K ✅ (DIY, lower fit)
- Town & Country Pest Solutions: 47.1K ✅
- Painting Business Pro (Eric Barstow): 45K+ ✅

### ⚠️ Estimated (Real channels, subscriber count approximate)
- Electrician U (Dustin Stelzer): 200K–500K (widely cited as top trades channel, exact count not confirmed in research)
- Mike Andes: 100K+ (referenced as top lawn care channel, exact count not scraped)
- Roofing Insights (Dmitry): 75K–100K (older articles cited 40K; likely grown significantly)
- The Roof Strategist: 60K+ (very active, estimated)
- HVAC School (Bryan Orr): 97K YT, much larger podcast audience
- King of Pressure Washing: 35–60K (active channel, exact count not confirmed)

### ❌ Hard to Find / Thin Verticals
- **Pest Control**: No single dominant contractor-focused YouTube creator above 75K subs. Industry relies more on trade publications (PCT Magazine) and podcasts. Recommend: Pest Geek Podcast + industry media outreach to supplement.
- **Painting**: Very thin YouTube ecosystem for painting contractors. Painting Business Pro is the clear leader at 45K but scale is limited. Recommend: pursue Barstow, supplement with painting contractor Facebook groups and podcasts.
- **Pressure Washing**: Smaller vertical overall. King of Pressure Washing has the strongest peer credibility but modest subscriber count.

### 📋 Channels Specifically NOT Recommended (Wrong Audience)
- The Lawn Care Nut (582K): Heavy DIY homeowner content — not contractor audience
- DoMyOwnPestControl (60K): DIY homeowners, not pest control operators
- Bob Ross (6.4M): Wrong kind of painting entirely
- Orkin Pest Control (18K): Corporate brand channel, not an influencer vehicle

## 7. Quick Reference — Outreach Checklist

For each creator:
- [ ] Watch 2–3 recent videos to understand their voice before reaching out
- [ ] Check if they already promote competitors (ServiceTitan, Jobber, etc.)
- [ ] Use direct email where available (found in YouTube About tab), not contact forms
- [ ] Follow on Instagram/social first — like 2–3 posts before cold outreach
- [ ] Reference a specific video in your outreach ("In your July video about dispatching...")
- [ ] Offer the free trial first — not a contract or commitment
- [ ] Lead with the co-branded page offer — it's unique and feels like partnership
