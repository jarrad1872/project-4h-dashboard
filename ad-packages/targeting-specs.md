## Trade Tier Reference

| Tier | Trades | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Tier 1 | pipe, mow, coat, duct, pest, electricians, roofrepair, disaster | High inbound call volume; strong CPL potential |
| Tier 2 | rinse, rooter, bodyshop, and others | Smaller addressable market; test with reduced budget |
| Saw.City (general) | `/li`, `/saw`, `/yt` | Brand awareness; broader targeting |

---

## Notes
- All ads should drive to UTM-tagged `.city` landing pages for clean attribution
- Retargeting audiences built from pixel data after first 2 weeks of traffic
- Review performance weekly; kill/scale based on CPL thresholds (see `budget-allocation.md`)
