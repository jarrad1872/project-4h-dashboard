|----------|---------------|-----------|
| LinkedIn | $5,000 | $166/day |

## Kill / Scale Thresholds

### Kill (pause or cut budget)
- **CPL > $40** after $500 spend on any single platform or campaign
- **CTR < 0.3%** after 1,000 impressions on any creative → pause that creative
- **0 conversions** after $200 spend on a specific ad set → pause and rework

### Scale (increase budget)
- **CPL < $20 AND 5+ sign-ups** on a platform → double that platform's daily budget
- **CTR > 1.5%** on a creative with 500+ impressions → increase that ad set budget by 50%
- **ROAS > 3x** after 30 days → shift additional budget from underperforming platforms

### Rebalance Triggers
- After 2 weeks: review platform performance; reallocate up to $1,000 from worst to best
- After 30 days: final rebalance based on CPA data; may shift up to 40% of total budget

## Notes
- Retargeting pools are seeded from weeks 1–2 traffic; retargeting campaigns launch in week 3
- A/B test 2–3 creative variants per trade at launch; consolidate budget to winners by week 3
- LinkedIn typically has higher CPL but better B2B intent; prioritize for operator/owner targeting
- Instagram/YouTube best for visual storytelling and under-35 trade owner demos
